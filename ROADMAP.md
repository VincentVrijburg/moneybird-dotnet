# Roadmap

This document aims to provide a clear overview of what we are planning to work on and in what time frame.

## v0.x.x

This version is solely for initial development and should not be considered "stable" and/or "complete" by any means.
Hence the decision to label each release within this version pattern as a "pre-release".

## v1.x.x

The goal is to provide a stable version that has the basic functionality to interact with the Moneybird API.
